# Bad Apple!! in ComputerCraft

## A CC:Tweaked script that plays Bad Apple in Minecraft.

Audio and video files are also here: `badapple.nfpa` is a video file, `badapple.dfpwm` is an audio one.

You can also find the script on Pastebin here: <https://pastebin.com/ZG7Ltkw3>

### Thanks to:

- **ZUN** – original composition
- **Alstroemeria Records and nomico** – this legendary remix
- **Archive.org Wayback Machine and whoever it was to snapshot my script earlier** – help in recovering a script after a sudden removal from Pastebin
